##Creating User Accounts Using a Python Script

Description:
In this lab (4), there will be an exploration of automating user creation by implementing a python script. Python is used for command line automation as many operations done to a server are automated. The virtual machine will be accessed using SSH terminal. 

Operation:
1. Create a GitHub Repo - storing the code
2. Create the 'create-users.py' script - this wil serve as the main took for automating user creation
3. Create the 'create-users.input' file - contain the input data for user creation
4. Create users with the 'create-users.py' script - execute the 'create-user.py' script to create users based on the data provided in 'create-users.input' file
5. Confirm the users have been created - confirm the creation of users by checking server environment
6. Sync Code with GitHub repo
